NAME
       POSIX - Perl interface to IEEE Std 1003.1

SYNOPSIS
           use POSIX;
           use POSIX qw(setsid);
           use POSIX qw(:errno_h :fcntl_h);

           printf "EINTR is %d\n", EINTR;

           $sess_id = POSIX::setsid();

           $fd = POSIX::open($path, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY, 0644);
               # note: that's a filedescriptor, *NOT* a filehandle

DESCRIPTION
       The POSIX module permits you to access all (or nearly all) the standard POSIX 1003.1 identifiers.  Many of these identifiers have
       been given Perl-ish interfaces.

       Everything is exported by default with the exception of any POSIX functions with the same name as a built-in Perl function, such as
       "abs", "alarm", "rmdir", "write", etc.., which will be exported only if you ask for them explicitly.  This is an unfortunate
       backwards compatibility feature.  You can stop the exporting by saying "use POSIX ()" and then use the fully qualified names (ie.
       "POSIX::SEEK_END").

       This document gives a condensed list of the features available in the POSIX module.  Consult your operating system's manpages for
       general information on most features.  Consult perlfunc for functions which are noted as being identical to Perl's builtin
       functions.

       The first section describes POSIX functions from the 1003.1 specification.  The second section describes some classes for signal
       objects, TTY objects, and other miscellaneous objects.  The remaining sections list various constants and macros in an organization
       which roughly follows IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993.

NOTE
       The POSIX module is probably the most complex Perl module supplied with the standard distribution.  It incorporates autoloading,
       namespace games, and dynamic loading of code that's in Perl, C, or both.  It's a great source of wisdom.

CAVEATS
       A few functions are not implemented because they are C specific.  If you attempt to call these, they will print a message telling
       you that they aren't implemented, and suggest using the Perl equivalent should one exist.  For example, trying to access the
       setjmp() call will elicit the message "setjmp() is C-specific: use eval {} instead".

       Furthermore, some evil vendors will claim 1003.1 compliance, but in fact are not so: they will not pass the PCTS (POSIX Compliance
       Test Suites).  For example, one vendor may not define EDEADLK, or the semantics of the errno values set by open(2) might not be
       quite right.  Perl does not attempt to verify POSIX compliance.  That means you can currently successfully say "use POSIX",  and
       then later in your program you find that your vendor has been lax and there's no usable ICANON macro after all.  This could be
       construed to be a bug.

FUNCTIONS
       _exit   This is identical to the C function "_exit()".  It exits the program immediately which means among other things buffered I/O
               is not flushed.

               Note that when using threads and in Linux this is not a good way to exit a thread because in Linux processes and threads are
               kind of the same thing (Note: while this is the situation in early 2003 there are projects under way to have threads with
               more POSIXly semantics in Linux).  If you want not to return from a thread, detach the thread.

       abort   This is identical to the C function "abort()".  It terminates the process with a "SIGABRT" signal unless caught by a signal
               handler or if the handler does not return normally (it e.g.  does a "longjmp").

       abs     This is identical to Perl's builtin "abs()" function, returning the absolute value of its numerical argument.

       access  Determines the accessibility of a file.

                       if( POSIX::access( "/", &POSIX::R_OK ) ){
                               print "have read permission\n";
                       }

               Returns "undef" on failure.  Note: do not use "access()" for security purposes.  Between the "access()" call and the
               operation you are preparing for the permissions might change: a classic race condition.

       acos    This is identical to the C function "acos()", returning the arcus cosine of its numerical argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       alarm   This is identical to Perl's builtin "alarm()" function, either for arming or disarming the "SIGARLM" timer.

       asctime This is identical to the C function "asctime()".  It returns a string of the form

                       "Fri Jun  2 18:22:13 2000\n\0"

               and it is called thusly

                       $asctime = asctime($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year,
                                          $wday, $yday, $isdst);

               The $mon is zero-based: January equals 0.  The $year is 1900-based: 2001 equals 101.  $wday and $yday default to zero (and
               are usually ignored anyway), and $isdst defaults to -1.

       asin    This is identical to the C function "asin()", returning the arcus sine of its numerical argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       assert  Unimplemented, but you can use "die" in perlfunc and the Carp module to achieve similar things.

       atan    This is identical to the C function "atan()", returning the arcus tangent of its numerical argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       atan2   This is identical to Perl's builtin "atan2()" function, returning the arcus tangent defined by its two numerical arguments,
               the y coordinate and the x coordinate.  See also Math::Trig.

       atexit  atexit() is C-specific: use "END {}" instead, see perlsub.

       atof    atof() is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force a scalar to a number, add a
               zero to it.

       atoi    atoi() is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force a scalar to a number, add a
               zero to it.  If you need to have just the integer part, see "int" in perlfunc.

       atol    atol() is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.  If you need to force a scalar to a number, add a
               zero to it.  If you need to have just the integer part, see "int" in perlfunc.

       bsearch bsearch() not supplied.  For doing binary search on wordlists, see Search::Dict.

       calloc  calloc() is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

       ceil    This is identical to the C function "ceil()", returning the smallest integer value greater than or equal to the given
               numerical argument.

       chdir   This is identical to Perl's builtin "chdir()" function, allowing one to change the working (default) directory, see "chdir"
               in perlfunc.

               Use the method "IO::Handle::clearerr()" instead, to reset the error state (if any) and EOF state (if any) of the given
               stream.

       clock   This is identical to the C function "clock()", returning the amount of spent processor time in microseconds.

       close   Close the file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_RDONLY );

               perlfunc.  See also Math::Trig.

       cosh    This is identical to the C function "cosh()", for returning the hyperbolic cosine of its numeric argument.  See also
               Math::Trig.

       creat   Create a new file.  This returns a file descriptor like the ones returned by "POSIX::open".  Use "POSIX::close" to close the
               file.

                       $fd = POSIX::creat( "foo", 0611 );
                       POSIX::close( $fd );

               See also "sysopen" in perlfunc and its "O_CREAT" flag.

                       $name = POSIX::cuserid();

       difftime
               This is identical to the C function "difftime()", for returning the time difference (in seconds) between two times (as
               returned by "time()"), see "time".

       div     div() is C-specific, use "int" in perlfunc on the usual "/" division and the modulus "%".

       dup     This is similar to the C function "dup()", for duplicating a file descriptor.

               This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

               It returns the remainder "$r = $x - $n*$y", where "$n = trunc($x/$y)".  The $r has the same sign as $x and magnitude
               (absolute value) less than the magnitude of $y.

               NOTE: if you have C programs that still use "gets()", be very afraid.  The "gets()" function is a source of endless grief
               because it has no buffer overrun checks.  It should never be used.  The "fgets()" function should be preferred instead.

               settings may affect what characters are considered "islower".  Does not work on Unicode characters code point 256 or higher.
               Consider using regular expressions and the "/[[:lower:]]/" construct instead.  Do not use "/[a-z]/".

       isprint This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale

               Consider using regular expressions and the "/[[:space:]]/" construct instead, or the "/\s/" construct.  (Note that "/\s/"
               and "/[[:space:]]/" are slightly different in that "/[[:space:]]/" can normally match a vertical tab, while "/\s/" does
               not.)

       isupper This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale
               settings may affect what characters are considered "isupper".  Does not work on Unicode characters code point 256 or higher.

       lchown  This is identical to the C function, except the order of arguments is consistent with Perl's builtin "chown()" with the
               added restriction of only one path, not an list of paths.  Does the same thing as the "chown()" function but changes the
               owner of a symbolic link instead of the file the symbolic link points to.

       ldexp   This is identical to the C function "ldexp()" for multiplying floating point numbers with powers of two.

                       $x_quadrupled = POSIX::ldexp($x, 2);

                       print "Locale = $loc\n";
                       $lconv = POSIX::localeconv();
                       print "decimal_point    = ", $lconv->{decimal_point},   "\n";
                       print "thousands_sep    = ", $lconv->{thousands_sep},   "\n";
                       print "grouping = ", $lconv->{grouping},        "\n";
                       print "int_curr_symbol  = ", $lconv->{int_curr_symbol}, "\n";

                       print "mon_thousands_sep = ", $lconv->{mon_thousands_sep}, "\n";
                       print "mon_grouping     = ", $lconv->{mon_grouping},    "\n";
                       print "positive_sign    = ", $lconv->{positive_sign},   "\n";
                       print "negative_sign    = ", $lconv->{negative_sign},   "\n";
                       print "int_frac_digits  = ", $lconv->{int_frac_digits}, "\n";
                       print "frac_digits      = ", $lconv->{frac_digits},     "\n";
                       print "p_cs_precedes    = ", $lconv->{p_cs_precedes},   "\n";
                       print "p_sep_by_space   = ", $lconv->{p_sep_by_space},  "\n";
                       print "n_cs_precedes    = ", $lconv->{n_cs_precedes},   "\n";
                       print "n_sep_by_space   = ", $lconv->{n_sep_by_space},  "\n";
                       print "p_sign_posn      = ", $lconv->{p_sign_posn},     "\n";
                       print "n_sign_posn      = ", $lconv->{n_sign_posn},     "\n";

       localtime
               This is identical to Perl's builtin "localtime()" function for converting seconds since the epoch to a date see "localtime"
               in perlfunc.

       log     This is identical to Perl's builtin "log()" function, returning the natural (e-based) logarithm of the numerical argument,
               see "log" in perlfunc.

       log10   This is identical to the C function "log10()", returning the 10-base logarithm of the numerical argument.  You can also use

                   sub log10 { log($_[0]) / log(10) }

               or

                   sub log10 { log($_[0]) / 2.30258509299405 }

               or

                   sub log10 { log($_[0]) * 0.434294481903252 }

       longjmp longjmp() is C-specific: use "die" in perlfunc instead.

       lseek   Move the file's read/write position.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_RDONLY );
                       $off_t = POSIX::lseek( $fd, 0, &POSIX::SEEK_SET );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       malloc  malloc() is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

       mblen   This is identical to the C function "mblen()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte characters of the
               C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       mbstowcs
               This is identical to the C function "mbstowcs()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte characters of
               the C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       mbtowc  This is identical to the C function "mbtowc()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte characters of the
               C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       memchr  memchr() is C-specific, see "index" in perlfunc instead.

                       if (mkfifo($path, $mode)) { ....

               Returns "undef" on failure.  The $mode is similar to the mode of "mkdir()", see "mkdir" in perlfunc, though for "mkfifo" you
               must specify the $mode.

       mktime  Convert date/time info to a calendar time.

               Synopsis:

                       mktime(sec, min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday = 0, yday = 0, isdst = -1)

               The month ("mon"), weekday ("wday"), and yearday ("yday") begin at zero.  I.e. January is 0, not 1; Sunday is 0, not 1;
               January 1st is 0, not 1.  The year ("year") is given in years since 1900.  I.e. The year 1995 is 95; the year 2001 is 101.
               Consult your system's "mktime()" manpage for details about these and the other arguments.

               Calendar time for December 12, 1995, at 10:30 am.

                       $time_t = POSIX::mktime( 0, 30, 10, 12, 11, 95 );
                       print "Date = ", POSIX::ctime($time_t);

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       modf    Return the integral and fractional parts of a floating-point number.

                       ($fractional, $integral) = POSIX::modf( 3.14 );

       nice    This is similar to the C function "nice()", for changing the scheduling preference of the current process.  Positive
               arguments mean more polite process, negative values more needy process.  Normal user processes can only be more polite.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       offsetof
               offsetof() is C-specific, you probably want to see "pack" in perlfunc instead.

       open    Open a file for reading for writing.  This returns file descriptors, not Perl filehandles.  Use "POSIX::close" to close the
               file.

               Open a file read-only with mode 0666.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo" );

               Open a file for read and write.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_RDWR );

               Open a file for write, with truncation.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_WRONLY | &POSIX::O_TRUNC );

               Create a new file with mode 0640.  Set up the file for writing.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_CREAT | &POSIX::O_WRONLY, 0640 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               See also "sysopen" in perlfunc.

       opendir Open a directory for reading.

                       $dir = POSIX::opendir( "/var" );
                       @files = POSIX::readdir( $dir );
                       POSIX::closedir( $dir );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       pathconf
               Retrieves the value of a configurable limit on a file or directory.

               The following will determine the maximum length of the longest allowable pathname on the filesystem which holds "/var".

                       $path_max = POSIX::pathconf( "/var", &POSIX::_PC_PATH_MAX );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       pause   This is similar to the C function "pause()", which suspends the execution of the current process until a signal is received.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       perror  This is identical to the C function "perror()", which outputs to the standard error stream the specified message followed by
               ": " and the current error string.  Use the "warn()" function and the $!  variable instead, see "warn" in perlfunc and
               "$ERRNO" in perlvar.

       pipe    Create an interprocess channel.  This returns file descriptors like those returned by "POSIX::open".

                       my ($read, $write) = POSIX::pipe();
                       POSIX::write( $write, "hello", 5 );
                       POSIX::read( $read, $buf, 5 );

               See also "pipe" in perlfunc.

       pow     Computes $x raised to the power $exponent.

                       $ret = POSIX::pow( $x, $exponent );

               You can also use the "**" operator, see perlop.

       putc    putc() is C-specific, see "print" in perlfunc instead.

       putchar putchar() is C-specific, see "print" in perlfunc instead.

       puts    puts() is C-specific, see "print" in perlfunc instead.

       qsort   qsort() is C-specific, see "sort" in perlfunc instead.

       raise   Sends the specified signal to the current process.  See also "kill" in perlfunc and the $$ in "$PID" in perlvar.

       rand    "rand()" is non-portable, see "rand" in perlfunc instead.

       read    Read from a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".  If the buffer $buf is not
               large enough for the read then Perl will extend it to make room for the request.

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_RDONLY );
                       $bytes = POSIX::read( $fd, $buf, 3 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               See also "sysread" in perlfunc.

       readdir This is identical to Perl's builtin "readdir()" function for reading directory entries, see "readdir" in perlfunc.

       realloc realloc() is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

       remove  This is identical to Perl's builtin "unlink()" function for removing files, see "unlink" in perlfunc.

       rewind  Seeks to the beginning of the file.

       rewinddir
               This is identical to Perl's builtin "rewinddir()" function for rewinding directory entry streams, see "rewinddir" in
               perlfunc.

       rmdir   This is identical to Perl's builtin "rmdir()" function for removing (empty) directories, see "rmdir" in perlfunc.

       scanf   scanf() is C-specific, use <> and regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       setgid  Sets the real group identifier and the effective group identifier for this process.  Similar to assigning a value to the
               Perl's builtin $) variable, see "$EGID" in perlvar, except that the latter will change only the real user identifier, and
               that the setgid() uses only a single numeric argument, as opposed to a space-separated list of numbers.

       setjmp  "setjmp()" is C-specific: use "eval {}" instead, see "eval" in perlfunc.

       setlocale
               Modifies and queries program's locale.  The following examples assume

                       use POSIX qw(setlocale LC_ALL LC_CTYPE);

               has been issued.

               The following will set the traditional UNIX system locale behavior (the second argument "C").

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_ALL, "C" );

               The following will query the current LC_CTYPE category.  (No second argument means 'query'.)

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE );

               The following will set the LC_CTYPE behaviour according to the locale environment variables (the second argument "").
               Please see your systems setlocale(3) documentation for the locale environment variables' meaning or consult perllocale.

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE, "" );

               The following will set the LC_COLLATE behaviour to Argentinian Spanish. NOTE: The naming and availability of locales depends
               on your operating system. Please consult perllocale for how to find out which locales are available in your system.

                       $loc = setlocale( LC_COLLATE, "es_AR.ISO8859-1" );

       setpgid This is similar to the C function "setpgid()" for setting the process group identifier of the current process.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       setsid  This is identical to the C function "setsid()" for setting the session identifier of the current process.

       setuid  Sets the real user identifier and the effective user identifier for this process.  Similar to assigning a value to the
               Perl's builtin $< variable, see "$UID" in perlvar, except that the latter will change only the real user identifier.

       sigaction
               Detailed signal management.  This uses "POSIX::SigAction" objects for the "action" and "oldaction" arguments (the oldaction
               can also be just a hash reference).  Consult your system's "sigaction" manpage for details, see also "POSIX::SigRt".

               Synopsis:

                       sigaction(signal, action, oldaction = 0)

               Returns "undef" on failure.  The "signal" must be a number (like SIGHUP), not a string (like "SIGHUP"), though Perl does try
               hard to understand you.

               If you use the SA_SIGINFO flag, the signal handler will in addition to the first argument, the signal name, also receive a
               second argument, a hash reference, inside which are the following keys with the following semantics, as defined by
               POSIX/SUSv3:

                   signo       the signal number
                   errno       the error number
                   code        if this is zero or less, the signal was sent by
                               a user process and the uid and pid make sense,
                               otherwise the signal was sent by the kernel

               The following are also defined by POSIX/SUSv3, but unfortunately not very widely implemented:

                   pid         the process id generating the signal
                   uid         the uid of the process id generating the signal
                   status      exit value or signal for SIGCHLD
                   band        band event for SIGPOLL

               A third argument is also passed to the handler, which contains a copy of the raw binary contents of the siginfo structure:
               if a system has some non-POSIX fields, this third argument is where to unpack() them from.

               Note that not all siginfo values make sense simultaneously (some are valid only for certain signals, for example), and not
               all values make sense from Perl perspective, you should to consult your system's "sigaction" and possibly also "siginfo"
               documentation.

       siglongjmp
               siglongjmp() is C-specific: use "die" in perlfunc instead.

       sigpending
               Examine signals that are blocked and pending.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for the "sigset" argument.  Consult your
               system's "sigpending" manpage for details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigpending(sigset)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       sigprocmask
               Change and/or examine calling process's signal mask.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for the "sigset" and "oldsigset"
               arguments.  Consult your system's "sigprocmask" manpage for details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigprocmask(how, sigset, oldsigset = 0)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               Note that you can't reliably block or unblock a signal from its own signal handler if you're using safe signals. Other
               signals can be blocked or unblocked reliably.

       sigsetjmp
               "sigsetjmp()" is C-specific: use "eval {}" instead, see "eval" in perlfunc.

       sigsuspend
               Install a signal mask and suspend process until signal arrives.  This uses "POSIX::SigSet" objects for the "signal_mask"
               argument.  Consult your system's "sigsuspend" manpage for details.

               Synopsis:

                       sigsuspend(signal_mask)

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       sin     This is identical to Perl's builtin "sin()" function for returning the sine of the numerical argument, see "sin" in
               perlfunc.  See also Math::Trig.

       sinh    This is identical to the C function "sinh()" for returning the hyperbolic sine of the numerical argument.  See also
               Math::Trig.

       sleep   This is functionally identical to Perl's builtin "sleep()" function for suspending the execution of the current for process
               for certain number of seconds, see "sleep" in perlfunc.  There is one significant difference, however: "POSIX::sleep()"
               returns the number of unslept seconds, while the "CORE::sleep()" returns the number of slept seconds.

       sprintf This is similar to Perl's builtin "sprintf()" function for returning a string that has the arguments formatted as requested,
               see "sprintf" in perlfunc.

       sqrt    This is identical to Perl's builtin "sqrt()" function.  for returning the square root of the numerical argument, see "sqrt"
               in perlfunc.

       srand   Give a seed the pseudorandom number generator, see "srand" in perlfunc.

       sscanf  sscanf() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strcat  strcat() is C-specific, use ".=" instead, see perlop.

       strchr  strchr() is C-specific, see "index" in perlfunc instead.

       strcmp  strcmp() is C-specific, use "eq" or "cmp" instead, see perlop.

       strcoll This is identical to the C function "strcoll()" for collating (comparing) strings transformed using the "strxfrm()"
               function.  Not really needed since Perl can do this transparently, see perllocale.

       strcpy  strcpy() is C-specific, use "=" instead, see perlop.

       strcspn strcspn() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strerror
               Returns the error string for the specified errno.  Identical to the string form of the $!, see "$ERRNO" in perlvar.

       strftime
               Convert date and time information to string.  Returns the string.

               Synopsis:

                       strftime(fmt, sec, min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday = -1, yday = -1, isdst = -1)

               The month ("mon"), weekday ("wday"), and yearday ("yday") begin at zero.  I.e. January is 0, not 1; Sunday is 0, not 1;
               January 1st is 0, not 1.  The year ("year") is given in years since 1900.  I.e., the year 1995 is 95; the year 2001 is 101.
               Consult your system's "strftime()" manpage for details about these and the other arguments.

               If you want your code to be portable, your format ("fmt") argument should use only the conversion specifiers defined by the
               ANSI C standard (C89, to play safe).  These are "aAbBcdHIjmMpSUwWxXyYZ%".  But even then, the results of some of the
               conversion specifiers are non-portable.  For example, the specifiers "aAbBcpZ" change according to the locale settings of
               the user, and both how to set locales (the locale names) and what output to expect are non-standard.  The specifier "c"
               changes according to the timezone settings of the user and the timezone computation rules of the operating system.  The "Z"
               specifier is notoriously unportable since the names of timezones are non-standard. Sticking to the numeric specifiers is the
               safest route.

               The given arguments are made consistent as though by calling "mktime()" before calling your system's "strftime()" function,
               except that the "isdst" value is not affected.

               The string for Tuesday, December 12, 1995.

                       $str = POSIX::strftime( "%A, %B %d, %Y", 0, 0, 0, 12, 11, 95, 2 );
                       print "$str\n";

       strlen  strlen() is C-specific, use "length()" instead, see "length" in perlfunc.

       strncat strncat() is C-specific, use ".=" instead, see perlop.

       strncmp strncmp() is C-specific, use "eq" instead, see perlop.

       strncpy strncpy() is C-specific, use "=" instead, see perlop.

       strpbrk strpbrk() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strrchr strrchr() is C-specific, see "rindex" in perlfunc instead.

       strspn  strspn() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre.

       strstr  This is identical to Perl's builtin "index()" function, see "index" in perlfunc.

       strtod  String to double translation. Returns the parsed number and the number of characters in the unparsed portion of the string.
               Truly POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation error, so clear $! before calling strtod.  However,
               non-POSIX systems may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

               strtod should respect any POSIX setlocale() settings.

               To parse a string $str as a floating point number use

                   $! = 0;
                   ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtod($str);

               The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

                   if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || $!) {
                       die "Non-numeric input $str" . ($! ? ": $!\n" : "\n");
                   }

               When called in a scalar context strtod returns the parsed number.

       strtok  strtok() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see perlre, or "split" in perlfunc.

       strtol  String to (long) integer translation.  Returns the parsed number and the number of characters in the unparsed portion of the
               string.  Truly POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation error, so clear $! before calling strtol.
               However, non-POSIX systems may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

               strtol should respect any POSIX setlocale() settings.

               To parse a string $str as a number in some base $base use

                   $! = 0;
                   ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtol($str, $base);

               The base should be zero or between 2 and 36, inclusive.  When the base is zero or omitted strtol will use the string itself
               to determine the base: a leading "0x" or "0X" means hexadecimal; a leading "0" means octal; any other leading characters
               mean decimal.  Thus, "1234" is parsed as a decimal number, "01234" as an octal number, and "0x1234" as a hexadecimal number.

               The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

                   if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || !$!) {
                       die "Non-numeric input $str" . $! ? ": $!\n" : "\n";
                   }

               When called in a scalar context strtol returns the parsed number.

       strtoul String to unsigned (long) integer translation.  strtoul() is identical to strtol() except that strtoul() only parses
               unsigned integers.  See "strtol" for details.

               Note: Some vendors supply strtod() and strtol() but not strtoul().  Other vendors that do supply strtoul() parse "-1" as a
               valid value.

       strxfrm String transformation.  Returns the transformed string.

                       $dst = POSIX::strxfrm( $src );

               Used in conjunction with the "strcoll()" function, see "strcoll".

               Not really needed since Perl can do this transparently, see perllocale.

       sysconf Retrieves values of system configurable variables.

               The following will get the machine's clock speed.

                       $clock_ticks = POSIX::sysconf( &POSIX::_SC_CLK_TCK );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       system  This is identical to Perl's builtin "system()" function, see "system" in perlfunc.

       tan     This is identical to the C function "tan()", returning the tangent of the numerical argument.  See also Math::Trig.

       tanh    This is identical to the C function "tanh()", returning the hyperbolic tangent of the numerical argument.   See also
               Math::Trig.

       tcdrain This is similar to the C function "tcdrain()" for draining the output queue of its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcflow  This is similar to the C function "tcflow()" for controlling the flow of its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcflush This is similar to the C function "tcflush()" for flushing the I/O buffers of its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcgetpgrp
               This is identical to the C function "tcgetpgrp()" for returning the process group identifier of the foreground process group
               of the controlling terminal.

       tcsendbreak
               This is similar to the C function "tcsendbreak()" for sending a break on its argument stream.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       tcsetpgrp
               This is similar to the C function "tcsetpgrp()" for setting the process group identifier of the foreground process group of
               the controlling terminal.

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       time    This is identical to Perl's builtin "time()" function for returning the number of seconds since the epoch (whatever it is
               for the system), see "time" in perlfunc.

       times   The times() function returns elapsed realtime since some point in the past (such as system startup), user and system times
               for this process, and user and system times used by child processes.  All times are returned in clock ticks.

                   ($realtime, $user, $system, $cuser, $csystem) = POSIX::times();

               Note: Perl's builtin "times()" function returns four values, measured in seconds.

       tmpfile Use method "IO::File::new_tmpfile()" instead, or see File::Temp.

       tmpnam  Returns a name for a temporary file.

                       $tmpfile = POSIX::tmpnam();

               For security reasons, which are probably detailed in your system's documentation for the C library tmpnam() function, this
               interface should not be used; instead see File::Temp.

       tolower This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a whole string.  Consider using
               the "lc()" function, see "lc" in perlfunc, or the equivalent "\L" operator inside doublequotish strings.

       toupper This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single character or to a whole string.  Consider using
               the "uc()" function, see "uc" in perlfunc, or the equivalent "\U" operator inside doublequotish strings.

       ttyname This is identical to the C function "ttyname()" for returning the name of the current terminal.

       tzname  Retrieves the time conversion information from the "tzname" variable.

                       POSIX::tzset();
                       ($std, $dst) = POSIX::tzname();

       tzset   This is identical to the C function "tzset()" for setting the current timezone based on the environment variable "TZ", to be
               used by "ctime()", "localtime()", "mktime()", and "strftime()" functions.

       umask   This is identical to Perl's builtin "umask()" function for setting (and querying) the file creation permission mask, see
               "umask" in perlfunc.

       uname   Get name of current operating system.

                       ($sysname, $nodename, $release, $version, $machine) = POSIX::uname();

               Note that the actual meanings of the various fields are not that well standardized, do not expect any great portability.
               The $sysname might be the name of the operating system, the $nodename might be the name of the host, the $release might be
               the (major) release number of the operating system, the $version might be the (minor) release number of the operating
               system, and the $machine might be a hardware identifier.  Maybe.

       ungetc  Use method "IO::Handle::ungetc()" instead.

       unlink  This is identical to Perl's builtin "unlink()" function for removing files, see "unlink" in perlfunc.

       utime   This is identical to Perl's builtin "utime()" function for changing the time stamps of files and directories, see "utime" in
               perlfunc.

       vfprintf
               vfprintf() is C-specific, see "printf" in perlfunc instead.

       vprintf vprintf() is C-specific, see "printf" in perlfunc instead.

       vsprintf
               vsprintf() is C-specific, see "sprintf" in perlfunc instead.

       wait    This is identical to Perl's builtin "wait()" function, see "wait" in perlfunc.

       waitpid Wait for a child process to change state.  This is identical to Perl's builtin "waitpid()" function, see "waitpid" in
               perlfunc.

                       $pid = POSIX::waitpid( -1, POSIX::WNOHANG );
                       print "status = ", ($? / 256), "\n";

       wcstombs
               This is identical to the C function "wcstombs()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte characters of
               the C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       wctomb  This is identical to the C function "wctomb()".  Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte characters of the
               C standards, so this might be a rather useless function.

       write   Write to a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by calling "POSIX::open".

                       $fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_WRONLY );
                       $buf = "hello";
                       $bytes = POSIX::write( $fd, $buf, 5 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

               See also "syswrite" in perlfunc.

CLASSES
   POSIX::SigAction
       new     Creates a new "POSIX::SigAction" object which corresponds to the C "struct sigaction".  This object will be destroyed
               automatically when it is no longer needed.  The first parameter is the handler, a sub reference.  The second parameter is a
               "POSIX::SigSet" object, it defaults to the empty set.  The third parameter contains the "sa_flags", it defaults to 0.

                       $sigset = POSIX::SigSet->new(SIGINT, SIGQUIT);
                       $sigaction = POSIX::SigAction->new( \&handler, $sigset, &POSIX::SA_NOCLDSTOP );

               This "POSIX::SigAction" object is intended for use with the "POSIX::sigaction()" function.

       handler
       mask
       flags   accessor functions to get/set the values of a SigAction object.

                       $sigset = $sigaction->mask;
                       $sigaction->flags(&POSIX::SA_RESTART);

       safe    accessor function for the "safe signals" flag of a SigAction object; see perlipc for general information on safe (a.k.a.
               "deferred") signals.  If you wish to handle a signal safely, use this accessor to set the "safe" flag in the
               "POSIX::SigAction" object:

                       $sigaction->safe(1);

               You may also examine the "safe" flag on the output action object which is filled in when given as the third parameter to
               "POSIX::sigaction()":

                       sigaction(SIGINT, $new_action, $old_action);
                       if ($old_action->safe) {
                           # previous SIGINT handler used safe signals
                       }

   POSIX::SigRt
       %SIGRT  A hash of the POSIX realtime signal handlers.  It is an extension of the standard %SIG, the $POSIX::SIGRT{SIGRTMIN} is
               roughly equivalent to $SIG{SIGRTMIN}, but the right POSIX moves (see below) are made with the POSIX::SigSet and
               POSIX::sigaction instead of accessing the %SIG.

               You can set the %POSIX::SIGRT elements to set the POSIX realtime signal handlers, use "delete" and "exists" on the elements,
               and use "scalar" on the %POSIX::SIGRT to find out how many POSIX realtime signals there are available (SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN +
               1, the SIGRTMAX is a valid POSIX realtime signal).

               Setting the %SIGRT elements is equivalent to calling this:

                 sub new {
                   my ($rtsig, $handler, $flags) = @_;
                   my $sigset = POSIX::SigSet($rtsig);
                   my $sigact = POSIX::SigAction->new($handler, $sigset, $flags);
                   sigaction($rtsig, $sigact);
                 }

               The flags default to zero, if you want something different you can either use "local" on $POSIX::SigRt::SIGACTION_FLAGS, or
               you can derive from POSIX::SigRt and define your own "new()" (the tied hash STORE method of the %SIGRT calls "new($rtsig,
               $handler, $SIGACTION_FLAGS)", where the $rtsig ranges from zero to SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1).

               Just as with any signal, you can use sigaction($rtsig, undef, $oa) to retrieve the installed signal handler (or, rather, the
               signal action).

               NOTE: whether POSIX realtime signals really work in your system, or whether Perl has been compiled so that it works with
               them, is outside of this discussion.

       SIGRTMIN
               Return the minimum POSIX realtime signal number available, or "undef" if no POSIX realtime signals are available.

       SIGRTMAX
               Return the maximum POSIX realtime signal number available, or "undef" if no POSIX realtime signals are available.

   POSIX::SigSet
       new     Create a new SigSet object.  This object will be destroyed automatically when it is no longer needed.  Arguments may be
               supplied to initialize the set.

               Create an empty set.

                       $sigset = POSIX::SigSet->new;

               Create a set with SIGUSR1.

                       $sigset = POSIX::SigSet->new( &POSIX::SIGUSR1 );

       addset  Add a signal to a SigSet object.

                       $sigset->addset( &POSIX::SIGUSR2 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       delset  Remove a signal from the SigSet object.

                       $sigset->delset( &POSIX::SIGUSR2 );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       emptyset
               Initialize the SigSet object to be empty.

                       $sigset->emptyset();

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       fillset Initialize the SigSet object to include all signals.

                       $sigset->fillset();

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       ismember
               Tests the SigSet object to see if it contains a specific signal.

                       if( $sigset->ismember( &POSIX::SIGUSR1 ) ){
                               print "contains SIGUSR1\n";
                       }

   POSIX::Termios
       new     Create a new Termios object.  This object will be destroyed automatically when it is no longer needed.  A Termios object
               corresponds to the termios C struct.  new() mallocs a new one, getattr() fills it from a file descriptor, and setattr() sets
               a file descriptor's parameters to match Termios' contents.

                       $termios = POSIX::Termios->new;

       getattr Get terminal control attributes.

               Obtain the attributes for stdin.

                       $termios->getattr( 0 ) # Recommended for clarity.
                       $termios->getattr()

               Obtain the attributes for stdout.

                       $termios->getattr( 1 )

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       getcc   Retrieve a value from the c_cc field of a termios object.  The c_cc field is an array so an index must be specified.

                       $c_cc[1] = $termios->getcc(1);

       getcflag
               Retrieve the c_cflag field of a termios object.

                       $c_cflag = $termios->getcflag;

       getiflag
               Retrieve the c_iflag field of a termios object.

                       $c_iflag = $termios->getiflag;

       getispeed
               Retrieve the input baud rate.

                       $ispeed = $termios->getispeed;

       getlflag
               Retrieve the c_lflag field of a termios object.

                       $c_lflag = $termios->getlflag;

       getoflag
               Retrieve the c_oflag field of a termios object.

                       $c_oflag = $termios->getoflag;

       getospeed
               Retrieve the output baud rate.

                       $ospeed = $termios->getospeed;

       setattr Set terminal control attributes.

               Set attributes immediately for stdout.

                       $termios->setattr( 1, &POSIX::TCSANOW );

               Returns "undef" on failure.

       setcc   Set a value in the c_cc field of a termios object.  The c_cc field is an array so an index must be specified.

                       $termios->setcc( &POSIX::VEOF, 1 );

       setcflag
               Set the c_cflag field of a termios object.

                       $termios->setcflag( $c_cflag | &POSIX::CLOCAL );

       setiflag
               Set the c_iflag field of a termios object.

                       $termios->setiflag( $c_iflag | &POSIX::BRKINT );

       setispeed
               Set the input baud rate.

                       $termios->setispeed( &POSIX::B9600 );

               WNOHANG WUNTRACED

               WNOHANG         Do not suspend the calling process until a child process changes state but instead return immediately.

               WUNTRACED       Catch stopped child processes.

               WIFEXITED       WIFEXITED(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns true if the child process exited normally ("exit()" or by falling
                               off the end of "main()")

               WEXITSTATUS     WEXITSTATUS(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns the normal exit status of the child process (only meaningful if

               WIFSIGNALED     WIFSIGNALED(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns true if the child process terminated because of a signal

               WTERMSIG        WTERMSIG(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns the signal the child process terminated for (only meaningful if
                               WIFSIGNALED(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) is true)

               WIFSTOPPED      WIFSTOPPED(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns true if the child process is currently stopped (can happen only
                               if you specified the WUNTRACED flag to waitpid())

               WSTOPSIG        WSTOPSIG(${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}) returns the signal the child process was stopped for (only meaningful if
