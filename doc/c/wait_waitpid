DESCRIPTION
       All  of  these  system  calls are used to wait for state changes in a child of the calling process, and obtain information about the
       child whose state has changed.  A state change is considered to be: the child terminated; the child was stopped by a signal; or  the
       child  was  resumed  by  a  signal.  In the case of a terminated child, performing a wait allows the system to release the resources
       associated with the child; if a wait is not performed, then the terminated child remains in a "zombie" state (see NOTES below).

       If a child has already changed state, then these calls return immediately.  Otherwise they block until either a child changes  state
       or  a  signal  handler  interrupts the call (assuming that system calls are not automatically restarted using the SA_RESTART flag of
       sigaction(2)).  In the remainder of this page, a child whose state has changed and which has not yet been  waited  upon  by  one  of
       these system calls is termed waitable.

   wait() and waitpid()
       The  wait()  system  call suspends execution of the calling process until one of its children terminates.  The call wait(&status) is
       equivalent to:

           waitpid(-1, &status, 0);

       The waitpid() system call suspends execution of the calling process until a child specified by pid argument has changed  state.   By
       default, waitpid() waits only for terminated children, but this behavior is modifiable via the options argument, as described below.

       The value of pid can be:

       < -1   meaning wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.

       -1     meaning wait for any child process.

       0      meaning wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the calling process.

       > 0    meaning wait for the child whose process ID is equal to the value of pid.

       The value of options is an OR of zero or more of the following constants:

       WNOHANG     return immediately if no child has exited.

       WUNTRACED   also  return  if  a  child has stopped (but not traced via ptrace(2)).  Status for traced children which have stopped is
                   provided even if this option is not specified.

       WCONTINUED (since Linux 2.6.10)
                   also return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

       (For Linux-only options, see below.)

       If status is not NULL, wait() and waitpid() store status information in the int to which it points.  This integer can  be  inspected
       with the following macros (which take the integer itself as an argument, not a pointer to it, as is done in wait() and waitpid()!):

       WIFEXITED(status)
              returns true if the child terminated normally, that is, by calling exit(3) or _exit(2), or by returning from main().

       WEXITSTATUS(status)
              returns  the  exit  status of the child.  This consists of the least significant 8 bits of the status argument that the child
              specified in a call to exit(3) or _exit(2) or as the argument for a return statement in main().  This macro  should  only  be
              employed if WIFEXITED returned true.

       WIFSIGNALED(status)
              returns true if the child process was terminated by a signal.

       WTERMSIG(status)
              returns  the  number of the signal that caused the child process to terminate.  This macro should only be employed if WIFSIG‐
              NALED returned true.

       WCOREDUMP(status)
              returns true if the child produced a core dump.  This macro should only be employed if WIFSIGNALED returned true.  This macro
              is  not  specified  in  POSIX.1-2001  and  is  not  available on some UNIX implementations (e.g., AIX, SunOS).  Only use this
              enclosed in #ifdef WCOREDUMP ... #endif.

       WIFSTOPPED(status)
              returns true if the child process was stopped by delivery of a signal; this is only possible if the call was done using  WUN‐
              TRACED or when the child is being traced (see ptrace(2)).

       WSTOPSIG(status)
              returns  the  number of the signal which caused the child to stop.  This macro should only be employed if WIFSTOPPED returned
              true.

       WIFCONTINUED(status)
              (since Linux 2.6.10) returns true if the child process was resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

   waitid()
       The waitid() system call (available since Linux 2.6.9) provides more precise control over which child state changes to wait for.

       The idtype and id arguments select the child(ren) to wait for, as follows:

       idtype == P_PID
              Wait for the child whose process ID matches id.

       idtype == P_PGID
              Wait for any child whose process group ID matches id.

       idtype == P_ALL
              Wait for any child; id is ignored.

       The child state changes to wait for are specified by ORing one or more of the following flags in options:

       WEXITED     Wait for children that have terminated.

       WSTOPPED    Wait for children that have been stopped by delivery of a signal.

       WCONTINUED  Wait for (previously stopped) children that have been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.

       The following flags may additionally be ORed in options:

       WNOHANG     As for waitpid().

       WNOWAIT     Leave the child in a waitable state; a later wait call can be used to again retrieve the child status information.

       Upon successful return, waitid() fills in the following fields of the siginfo_t structure pointed to by infop:

       si_pid      The process ID of the child.

       si_uid      The real user ID of the child.  (This field is not set on most other implementations.)

       si_signo    Always set to SIGCHLD.

       si_status   Either the exit status of the child, as given to _exit(2) (or exit(3)), or the signal that caused the  child  to  termi‐
                   nate, stop, or continue.  The si_code field can be used to determine how to interpret this field.

       si_code     Set to one of: CLD_EXITED (child called _exit(2)); CLD_KILLED (child killed by signal); CLD_DUMPED (child killed by sig‐
                   nal, and dumped core); CLD_STOPPED (child stopped by signal); CLD_TRAPPED (traced child has trapped);  or  CLD_CONTINUED
                   (child continued by SIGCONT).

       If  WNOHANG  was  specified  in  options and there were no children in a waitable state, then waitid() returns 0 immediately and the
       state of the siginfo_t structure pointed to by infop is unspecified.  To distinguish this case from that where  a  child  was  in  a
       waitable state, zero out the si_pid field before the call and check for a nonzero value in this field after the call returns.

RETURN VALUE
       wait(): on success, returns the process ID of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.

       waitpid():  on  success,  returns  the  process  ID  of  the child whose state has changed; if WNOHANG was specified and one or more
       child(ren) specified by pid exist, but have not yet changed state, then 0 is returned.  On error, -1 is returned.

       waitid(): returns 0 on success or if WNOHANG was specified and no child(ren) specified by id has yet changed state; on error, -1  is
       returned.  Each of these calls sets errno to an appropriate value in the case of an error.

ERRORS
       ECHILD (for wait()) The calling process does not have any unwaited-for children.

       ECHILD (for  waitpid()  or waitid()) The process specified by pid (waitpid()) or idtype and id (waitid()) does not exist or is not a
              child of the calling process.  (This can happen for one's own child if the action for SIGCHLD is set to  SIG_IGN.   See  also
              the Linux Notes section about threads.)

       EINTR  WNOHANG was not set and an unblocked signal or a SIGCHLD was caught; see signal(7).

       EINVAL The options argument was invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       A  child  that  terminates, but has not been waited for becomes a "zombie".  The kernel maintains a minimal set of information about
       the zombie process (PID, termination status, resource usage information) in order to allow the parent to later  perform  a  wait  to
       obtain  information  about  the child.  As long as a zombie is not removed from the system via a wait, it will consume a slot in the
       kernel process table, and if this table fills, it will not be possible to create further processes.  If a parent process terminates,
       then its "zombie" children (if any) are adopted by init(8), which automatically performs a wait to remove the zombies.

       POSIX.1-2001  specifies that if the disposition of SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN or the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is set for SIGCHLD (see sigac‐
       tion(2)), then children that terminate do not become zombies and a call to wait() or waitpid() will block until  all  children  have
       terminated,  and  then  fail with errno set to ECHILD.  (The original POSIX standard left the behavior of setting SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN
       unspecified.  Note that even though the default disposition of SIGCHLD is "ignore", explicitly setting the  disposition  to  SIG_IGN
       results in different treatment of zombie process children.)  Linux 2.6 conforms to this specification.  However, Linux 2.4 (and ear‐
       lier) does not: if a wait() or waitpid() call is made while SIGCHLD is being ignored, the call behaves just as though  SIGCHLD  were
       not  being  ignored,  that  is,  the  call blocks until the next child terminates and then returns the process ID and status of that
       child.

   Linux Notes
       In the Linux kernel, a kernel-scheduled thread is not a distinct construct from a process.  Instead, a thread is  simply  a  process
       that  is  created using the Linux-unique clone(2) system call; other routines such as the portable pthread_create(3) call are imple‐
       mented using clone(2).  Before Linux 2.4, a thread was just a special case of a process, and as a consequence one thread  could  not
       wait on the children of another thread, even when the latter belongs to the same thread group.  However, POSIX prescribes such func‐
       tionality, and since Linux 2.4 a thread can, and by default will, wait on children of other threads in the same thread group.

       The following Linux-specific options are for use with children created using clone(2); they cannot be used with waitid():

       __WCLONE
              Wait for "clone" children only.  If omitted then wait for "non-clone" children only.  (A "clone" child is one which  delivers
              no  signal,  or a signal other than SIGCHLD to its parent upon termination.)  This option is ignored if __WALL is also speci‐
              fied.

       __WALL (since Linux 2.4)
              Wait for all children, regardless of type ("clone" or "non-clone").

       __WNOTHREAD (since Linux 2.4)
              Do not wait for children of other threads in the same thread group.  This was the default before Linux 2.4.

EXAMPLE
       The following program demonstrates the use of fork(2) and waitpid().  The program creates a child process.  If no command-line argu‐
       ment  is  supplied  to  the  program, then the child suspends its execution using pause(2), to allow the user to send signals to the
       child.  Otherwise, if a command-line argument is supplied, then the child exits immediately, using the integer supplied on the  com‐
       mand  line as the exit status.  The parent process executes a loop that monitors the child using waitpid(), and uses the W*() macros
       described above to analyze the wait status value.

       The following shell session demonstrates the use of the program:

           $ ./a.out &
           Child PID is 32360
           [1] 32359
           $ kill -STOP 32360
           stopped by signal 19
           $ kill -CONT 32360
           continued
           $ kill -TERM 32360
           killed by signal 15
           [1]+  Done                    ./a.out
           $
